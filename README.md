# Simulation-of-balls
## Simple simulation of the movement of balls and their collisions in Java using JFrame
The project is an ordinary window in which colorful balls of different sizes move. The project is written and works in java.
### Control keys
+ When you press the left mouse button without moving to the field, a new random ball with a random direction of movement is created at the place of pressing.
+ If you hold down the same key and pull, then when released, a random new ball will fly towards the mouse at a speed proportional to the length of the path of the clamped mouse.
+ If you hold down the Ctrl key and click on the ball with the left mouse button, it will be deleted.

The window size can be changed.<br>
Good luck and have fun (huh, you won't succeed)
